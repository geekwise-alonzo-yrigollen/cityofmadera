ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

Madera County, “The Perfect Location” encompasses an area of 2,147 square miles and offers two distinct regions. Recognized as one of the world’s most productive agricultural regions, the Central Valley is currently experiencing an upsurge in population and business growth. The county’s largest manufacturing firms are located in the valley region. Eastern Madera County includes small communities such as Oakhurst, Coarsegold, North Fork and others that are situated in the Sierra Foothills and tourism-related activities are a major component of the economy. Madera County is one of the fastest growing counties in California, the population has increased from 124,696 in 2000 to an estimated 150,887 in 2008 (California State Department of Finance).

 

The recent influx of new residents and businesses into Madera County illustrates the increased awareness of the potential to be found in California’s Central Valley. The entire region is in the midst of a development phase, as companies take advantage of the centralized location, available labor force, affordable lifestyle and other favorable factors.
